# Exquisite Corpse

### Summary

A project that tries to link collective intelligence, mass art and mobile art.

Collective Intelligence: to produce a work that far exceeds the sum of individual contributions. A strong requirement is that authors act by ignoring the place that their contribution will take in the overall work.

Mass collective art: to offer the possibility to the greatest number to participate in this work.

Mobile art: participate in this work via the smartphone.

To link these requirements, it was chosen to develop an adaptation of the exquisite corpse in the form of an unlimited photographic canvas where the photographic contributions of each come to fit together to find their place in a global work.
